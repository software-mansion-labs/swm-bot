# Examples

This directory contains YAML example workflows in batteries-included style ðŸ”‹âš¡ with caching and cancelling ongoing actions. They can be copied'n'pasted to your project with the least amount of configuration needed.

Detailed documentation of the actions can be found in [the main README](../README.md).

## Actions structure

```yml
name: Action Name
# Conditions on which action is executed
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created, edited]

jobs:
  main:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Actions
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
# Repository within actions are implemented
          repository: 'software-mansion-labs/swmansion-bot'
# You can omit this to use actions from the main branch (not recommended)
          ref: stable

# Installation
      - name: Install Actions
        run: yarn install

# Action execution
      - name: Action Name
# Directory in which action is stored within repo eg. ./needs-repro
        uses: ./action-directory
# Action inputs
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          string-input: my-input
          semicolon-separated-input: 'Section1;Section2' 
          json-input: '{"key": "value"}'
```

This is a simplified example. We highly recommend caching installed packages with [@actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache).
