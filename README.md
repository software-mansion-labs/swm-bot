# swmansion-bot

GitHub Actions for triaging issues in Software Mansion Open Source projects.

This project is fondly known within Software Mansion as Bot Szczepan (eng. Stephen) ü§ñ

`swmansion-bot` is a successor to the [issue-validator](https://github.com/karol-bisztyga/issue-validator) created by [@karol-bisztyga](https://github.com/karol-bisztyga) üôå

## Repo layout

```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common # utility functions reused between actions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples # yaml files showing how to use actions within your project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ needs-more-info # action used for checking whether the issue template fields are filled
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ needs-repro # action used for checking whether issue has a snack, GitHub repo or a snippet of code
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ platforms # action that assigns labels to user-selected platforms in the issue template
```

Repository consists of a few GitHub Actions that are implemented in self-contained manner - each one should be independent of each other.

Each action is placed in a separate directory, and because they are implemented in JavaScript, they must have at least two files - `action.yml` and `index.js`. The `action.yml` file is the file that contains name, description and inputs that action can accept. The `index.js` is a code entry file. Logic that is not directly related to GitHub API manipulation (such as validation or formating) is split into separated files is the action directory.

## Actions

Examples of use can be found in [the examples/ directory](./examples/README.md).
